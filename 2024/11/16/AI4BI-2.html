<p>Business Information applications help businesses use their data as a resource to make critical decisions and we are going to build one with AI.</p>

<p>AI will inevitably play an ever-increasing role in BI tools; more specifically, LLM-based applications will allow BI apps to create visualizations, provide insights through data analysis, and automate business reporting.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we will explore how an  LLM application can help create business information. It won’t be a full-blown BI application, it will, however, automatically create charts and a textual report directly from data.</p>

<p>We will use the OpenAI API via CrewAI to build a program that will show the potential of AI in this field and will result in a simple AI-driven BI application.</p>

<p>I should point out that I am using these particular components as they are convenient - I used CrewAI in a recent <a href="https://datavizandai.github.io/2024/09/28/AI_Agents_vs._AI_Pipelines-3A_a_Practical_Guide_to_Coding_Your_LLM_Application.html">tutorial</a> (if you are new to CrewAI, I would encourage you to read it) and am getting comfortable with it CrewAI uses OpenAI by default, so I’ve gone with that, too.</p>

<p>Another LLM, such as Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, etc. would be as effective and, equally, while CrewAI is easy to use, another AI agent framework such as Autogen, or a similar, that supports code execution would be suitable, too.</p>

<p>Here, I am using the open-source offering from CrewAI which is, of course, free to use; OpenAI requires an API key and so you have to sign up and will be charged for use[1].</p>

<h3 id="the-bi-apps-and-data">The BI apps and data</h3>

<p>There are two types of functionality that we are going to explore: creating charts and reporting in text. Both of these require an LLM that can analyse and make sense of data - that shouldn’t be difficult for most modern LLMs.</p>

<p>We’ll create two agents: one that creates charts and one that analyses the data and creates a report.</p>

<p>The data we will use is in CSV format and is entirely fictional. It was created with a ChatGPT and concerns and a company that sells an unlikely range of products (from smart TVs to bed frames) in various regions across the world.</p>

<p>There are three tables. The first records the monthly sales.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/CrewAIapps/blob/main/images/AIBI/monthly_sales_data.png?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second shows the sales of the top-selling products in each region.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/CrewAIapps/blob/main/images/AIBI/sales_by_region_data.png?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>And the third details the sales of each item.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/CrewAIapps/blob/main/images/AIBI/sales_product_summary_data.png?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>Is this a realistic set of data that a sales director might find useful? I will freely admit that I don’t have a clue. I don’t own a company and I don’t sell anything, so I cannot claim any expertise in this area.</p>

<p>However, I’m not sure that it matters that much. We can use the data that ChatGPT has given me, create charts, and do some analysis and reporting, whether or not this data is precisely (or even vaguely) typical.</p>

<p>So let’s get started. I’m using Jupyter Lab to code these examples and you can find all the notebooks in my <a href="https://github.com/alanjones2/CrewAIapps">GitHub repo</a> in the <strong>AIBI-3</strong> folder.</p>

<p>Charts are always a feature of BI reporting so let’s start with them.</p>

<h3 id="chart-maker">Chart Maker</h3>

<p>First, we’ll take the CSV files and get the LLM to create charts from it. Below is an example - it was generated with Matplotlib.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/CrewAIapps/blob/main/images/AIBI/monthly_sales.png?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>We’ll be using the LLM to generate code and CrewAI to run it.</p>

<p>Running LLM-generated code is potentially unsafe because an LLM can produce arbitrary code that is not necessarily what we want (it may hallucinate something that when run could cause damage in the local file system).</p>

<p>For this reason, it either needs to be checked by a human first or run in some sort of sandbox. There are different approaches to this, Autogen, for example, gives you a choice of how you run code but CrewAI opts for safety first and all code is run in a Docker container which is isolated from the the local file system.</p>

<p>So that means you need to have Docker running on your local machine. This is straightforward - just go to the <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker website</a>, download the desktop app for your operating system, install it, and run it. You don’t need to create an account or sign in - you don’t even need to know anything about Docker, just let it run and CrewAI will use it.</p>

<p>We will let the LLM decide what charts it would like to create and we’ll see how that goes. I’ve coded each of the code blocks below in a separate Jupyter code cell; together they will build up the complete program.</p>

<p>We will be using the default OpenAI API[1] and that means that your API key should be accessible as an environment variable. If it is stored as an environment variable, you will need to run the following code block first.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">os</span>
<span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">OPENAI_API_KEY</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">your api key</span><span class="sh">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get started you first import the necessary libraries and set the LLM model.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="n">crewai</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Agent</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Task</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Crew</span>
<span class="n">llm</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">gpt-4o-mini</span><span class="sh">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A CrewAI app consists of a few elements: agents, tasks and a crew that runs the tasks and agents. We’ll see how they are used as we go. (For a more detailed introduction to CrewAI, see my article, <a href="https://alanjones2.github.io/articles/agentpipeline/text/article.html">AI Agents vs. AI Pipelines: a Practical Guide to Coding Your LLM Application</a> which introduces CrewAI.)</p>

<p>In order to do stuff that the LLM is not capable of, we also need to provide the agents with tools - again we’ll see them at work, shortly.</p>

<p>The tools that we need here allow the LLM to read the data files as well as write charts and reports to the local file system. So, next, we import the CrewAI tools required to read and write files.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="n">crewai_tools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FileReadTool</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">FileWriterTool</span>

<span class="n">file_writer_tool</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">FileWriterTool</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much of the work in a CrewAI app is done by one or more agents. Below, we set up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chart_agent</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Define agent

    <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that this is an object instantiated from the CrewAI <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents">Agent</a> class. The first three parameters are used to create a system prompt - what we expect the agent to do is defined in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goal</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backstory</code> parameters. And you can also see that we have declared the tools that the LLM can use as well as referring to the LLM that we will be using.</p>

<p>We’ve given the agent instructions that will give it autonomy in what it creates unless it is given specific instructions.</p>

<p>Significantly, we set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allow_code_execution</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code>. This implicitly allows the LLM to use its code execution tool and run code in Docker.</p>

<p>I’ve defined the files that we are going to use in a Python <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dict</code> - the data files exist already, of course, and the image file is where we want the charts to be saved.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">files</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next thing to data is to create a Task which further defines what we want to do. It tells the agent to create a chart for a data file and save it in a local file. We also need to specify the appropriate agent (there could be more than one) and the tools that will be necessary.</p>

<p>Lastly, we set up a Crew. This defines the list of agents and the lists of tasks that we want to run (in this case the lists only have one element). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verbose</code> parameter does what you would expect; when set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> the agent will write all of its thinking to the console. If you don’t want to be inundated with a large amount of text then set this to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code>.</p>

<p>Well, almost lastly. We need to set off the crew and collect the result, of course. Often we will use the method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crew.kickoff()</code> but in this case, we have a list of files that we want processed and CrewAI gives us a useful method that will iterate through a list in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crew.kickoff_for_each()</code> and as we see below this takes a list as a parameter.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">create_chart</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Task</span><span class="p">(</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the crew like this produces an awful lot of text which I am not going to reproduce here but which details the steps that the agent is going through. The sequence of events is this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">files_read_tool</code> to read the data file</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send the data to the LLM to analyse the data and produce the code that creates a Matplotlib chart</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>run the LLM-generated code in Docker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file_writer_tool</code> to write the chart to a PNG file in the local file system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It will do this for each data file and if you have the Docker window open you will see that it runs the code interpreter image as necessary.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/CrewAIapps/blob/main/images/Screenshot-docker.png?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the code is generated by an LLM, we cannot guarantee that it will produce the same result each time. However, it seems fairly consistent. An image is produced for each data file; the Monthly Sales Data can be seen at the beginning of this section and the other two are reproduced below.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/CrewAIapps/blob/main/images/AIBI/sales_by_region.png?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/alanjones2/CrewAIapps/blob/main/images/AIBI/sales_product_summary.png?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="an-agent-generated-report">An agent-generated report</h2>

<p>Now we have the charts, let’s move on to generating a report that will be the result of some simple analysis and question-answering by the LLM. This and  links to the previously generated images will then be combined into a Markdown file and this will be the final report.</p>

<p>We need a new agent for this; we’ll call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data_analysis_agent</code>.</p>

<p>We set up the agent much in the same format as before but, of course, the role, goal and backstory are different. Also, this time, we disable code execution as we do not need it to create a report.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">data_analysis_agent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Agent</span><span class="p">(</span>

    <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The task that the agent will be assigned is different this time, of course. The description tells the agent what to do: the first couple of sentences give the agent the files that it will need (the data and the charts) and then there is a list of questions that the LLM should attempt to answer. It is also told where to save the report and that it should be in Markdown format.</p>

<p>Note that the files are also included after the question; the reason for this is that, in an earlier version of the program, the LLM seemed to forget about the chart files and including them again fixes the problem.</p>

<p>Following the task definition we set up the crew and execute it.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">write_report</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Task</span><span class="p">(</span>

<p>The resulting report is too long to include in the text, so I’ve appended it to the end of the article. However, the program makes a reasonable attempt to answer the questions and faithfully includes the charts.</p>

<p>The report is short and a more sophisticated prompt might well result in something more comprehensive. However, when designing the prompt, one has to be careful not to provide inappropriate hints to the LLM. For example, I cut and pasted some suggestions from a ChatGPT session which included questions about supply chain problems. Of course, there is no way that you could deduce such a problem from the data given but the LLM hallucinated a fictitious supply chain problem to explain a downturn in sales!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-and-towards-a-more-useful-program">Conclusion and towards a more useful program</h3>

<p>It’s remarkably simple to create a very basic BI report writer like this but many improvements could be made to both the chart creation and the report writing.</p>

<p>This program is pretty generic, it will take any set of CSV files and do its best to interpret them and construct suitable charts. We could tailor it better to a particular application by including a description of the data file in the  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">files</code> data structure and we could also add a specification of the chart that we wanted to create - the agent is already primed to expect this but we would need to make some minor changes to incorporate the data description. Both of these measures would help to make sure that the output is more consistent and better meets our needs.</p>

<p>The report writing prompt could also be made more specific to a particular application and expanded to give a longer report. </p>

<p>If we were to take both that prompt and the files data structure out into a separate file, this would allow the program to be tuned for different applications.</p>

<p>This has been a basic foray into using AI to produce a BI report but there is significant room for improvement. Using an external file to specify more detailed data file descriptions and explicit chart specifications would allow non-programmers to tailor the program to their specific needs while maintaining the program’s generic nature. And of course, a Jupyter Notebook is not necessarily the best vehicle for an application that is to be used by non-programmers. But I hope that this has been food for thought.</p>
